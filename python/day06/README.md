## -= Puzzle 6: Bird Spotters =-

After the long train journey, you finally arrive at the **Annual Bird Spotting Contest** in C-land. The room is filled with excitement and the smell of fresh coffee.

As you get seated, the presenter (the same guy at the Banena™ competition) behind the stage starts explaining the rules of the contest.

The contest is simple: you need to take a picture of as many birds as possible in a given time.

You are provided with a list of birds and their speeds (your puzzle input), both for the x and the y speed. Each line represents a bird.

**The birds start at position x: 0, y: 0** in the sky, and each second, they move the exact amount given by their speed.

Because this is C-land, the birds overflow when they reach the edge of the sky and **wrap around to the other side**.

Birds can also **underflow when they go backwards below 0** and wrap around to the other side.

For this next example, the sky is 8x8, and the birds have the following speeds:

The puzzle input:

    1,0
    0,1
    1,1
    1,-1
    -1,1
    -1,-1

The corresponding birds' speeds:

    Bird 1: x: 1, y: 0
    Bird 2: x: 0, y: 1
    Bird 3: x: 1, y: 1
    Bird 4: x: 1, y: -1
    Bird 5: x: -1, y: 1
    Bird 6: x: -1, y: -1

After 1 second, the birds are at the following positions:

    Bird 1: x: 1, y: 0
    Bird 2: x: 0, y: 1
    Bird 3: x: 1, y: 1
    Bird 4: x: 1, y: 7 // -1 wraps around to 7
    Bird 5: x: 7, y: 1 // -1 wraps around to 7
    Bird 6: x: 7, y: 7 // -1 wraps around to 7

After 2 seconds, the birds are at the following positions:

    Bird 1: x: 2, y: 0
    Bird 2: x: 0, y: 2
    Bird 3: x: 2, y: 2
    Bird 4: x: 2, y: 6
    Bird 5: x: 6, y: 2
    Bird 6: x: 6, y: 6

Until the birds are at the following positions after 7 seconds:

    Bird 1: x: 7, y: 0
    Bird 2: x: 0, y: 7
    Bird 3: x: 7, y: 7
    Bird 4: x: 7, y: 1
    Bird 5: x: 1, y: 7
    Bird 6: x: 1, y: 1

And then positively overflowing/reaching zero at 8 seconds:

    Bird 1: x: 0, y: 0
    Bird 2: x: 0, y: 0
    Bird 3: x: 0, y: 0
    Bird 4: x: 0, y: 0
    Bird 5: x: 0, y: 0
    Bird 6: x: 0, y: 0

Now, taking a picture only captures birds that are in the frame.

In this case, the frame is 4x4, and the center is in the middle of the sky (x:between 3 and 4, y:between 3 and 4).

We can picture that grid as:

    ........
    ........
    ..####..
    ..####..
    ..####..
    ..####..
    ........
    ........

The area marked with the **#** is the area in which the picture can view the birds.

When taking the picture, you count the number of birds in the frame.

For the real contest, **the sky is 1000x1000, and the picture frame is 500x500.**

That picture frame is also centered in the middle of the sky (top left corner starting at (250, 250)).

You take your picture **exactly 100 seconds** after the start.

_How many birds are in the frame when you take your picture?_

Your answer was: `260`

## -= Part 2: Bird Marathon =-

Relieved that the contest is now over, you sit down to enjoy a nice cup of coffee.

But suddenly, the presenter makes an announcement: "Thank you for participating in the warmup! Let's begin the real contest!"

_You spit out your coffee in surprise._

The contest is not over yet! The new rules are as follows:

You get to take **1000 pictures** instead of just one and you have **1000 hours** to take the pictures.

You can't wait that long! You have stuff to do! You decide to automate the process by automatically **taking 1 picture every hour (3600 seconds) 1000 times**.

Once you have the 1000 pictures after 1000 hours your score is **the sum of all the picture's bird counts**.

**The sky and picture sizes remain unchanged.**

_What is the sum of all 1000 pictures' bird counts when taking a picture every 3600 seconds?_

Your answer was: `137200`

## -= Part 3: Immortal Birds =-

After setting all that up, the presenter suddenly announces: "Oops, I misspoke earlier. **Instead of 1000 hours, you have 1000 years to take 1000 pictures!**"

_You spit out your second coffee in utter surprise._

A year is 31556926 seconds long, so you have **a total of 31556926000 seconds to take 1000 pictures**.

You decide to automate taking **a picture every 31556926 seconds**, which is once every year.

**The sky and picture sizes remain unchanged**

_What is the sum of all 1000 pictures' bird counts when taking a picture every 31556926 seconds?_

Your answer was: `247208`

You've completed all the parts for this puzzle! This earns you 3 Pointers \*\*\*!
