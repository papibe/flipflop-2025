## -= Puzzle 5: Strange Tunnels =-

You arrive at the train station in C-land, ready to explore the vast network of tunnels.

As you board one of the trains, you look ahead and see a long series of tunnels.

Each tunnel is labeled with a single letter and has exactly two ends.

You're given a sequence of tunnel labels (your puzzle input). Each tunnel is represented by **a single uppercase or lowercase letter**.

Each letter appears exactly **twice**, representing the two ends of a single tunnel.

Example Input:

    ABccksiPiBAksP

This input contains seven different tunnels: `A`, `B`, `c`, `k`, `s`, `i`, and `P`.

The train **starts at the first tunnel and moves through the sequence in the order the tunnels appear**.

When it enters a tunnel, it **instantly moves to the matching letter's position**.

The number of steps taken inside a tunnel is equal to **the number of characters between the two ends of that tunnel plus the exit step.**

In the following diagram, arrows indicate the direction of travel between matching tunnel ends:

    ABccksiPiBAksP
    |---------^      // A -> A  (10 steps)
    ABccksiPiBAksP
        ^------|     // k <- k  (7 steps)
    ABccksiPiBAksP
         |------^    // s -> s  (7 steps)
    ABccksiPiBAksP
           ^-----|   // P <- P  (6 steps)
    ABccksiPiBAksP
          ^-|        // i <- i  (2 steps)
    ABccksiPiBAksP
           |-----^   // P -> P  (6 steps, end of line)

The train moves forward or backward, depending on which tunnel it is currently in.

Counting the steps taken inside each tunnel, we get:

    A -> A  = 10 steps
    k <- k  =  7 steps
    s -> s  =  7 steps
    P <- P  =  6 steps
    i <- i  =  2 steps
    P -> P  =  6 steps
    ------------------
    Total   = 38 steps

Keep in mind that the step from one tunnel to the next is not counted. (Outside the tunnel)

_What is the total number of steps the train takes inside tunnels for the full map?_

Your answer was: `1955`

## -= Part 2: Unused Tunnels =-

After exploring the tunnels, you realize that some tunnels are not visited by the train.

You have to know which tunnels are **not visited** so you can plan another trip to go back and visit them still.

In the previous example, the train visits the tunnels `A`, `k`, `s`, `i`, and `P`.

The tunnels `B` and `c` are not visited.

The answer, in the order in which they appear, is **Bc**.

_What tunnels are not visited by the train on the full map?_ (Answer must be in order of appearance)

Your answer was: `eBnXhWDRUCbVZw`

## -= Part 3: Powered Tunnels =-

As you near the first tunnel, you notice a sign that says **"Powered Tunnels"**.

Curious, you read the sign and learn that these tunnels have special properties.

When the train enters a powered tunnel, it emerges at the other end having taken a **negative number of steps** (don't question it).

A powered tunnel is represented by an **uppercase letter**.

Example Walkthrough:

    A -> A  = -10 steps
    k <- k  =   7 steps
    s -> s  =   7 steps
    P <- P  =  -6 steps
    i <- i  =   2 steps
    P -> P  =  -6 steps
    -------------------
    Total   =  -6 steps

Since A and P are powered tunnels, the train takes negative steps for those tunnels.

_What is the total number of steps the train takes inside tunnels for the full map with these new rules?_

Your answer was: `251`
