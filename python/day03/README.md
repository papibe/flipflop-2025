## -= Puzzle 3: Bush Salesman =-

A Bush Salesman has a job for you: they want your help with their sales. They have a list of bushes they want to sell, and they want you to check how many of them can be sold.

The list of bushes (your puzzle input) consists of a series of bushes, each represented by a color.

The color of a bush is defined as an **RGB value.** (Although the range is 10 to 99 instead of 0 to 255)

The first number represents the amount of **red**, the second number represents the amount of **green**, and the third number represents the amount of **blue**.

**Each number is separated by a comma.**

To begin with, the salesman wants to sell bushes of the **most common color**.

**For example:**

Take this list of bushes:

    10,20,30
    20,10,30
    30,20,10
    10,50,10
    50,10,50
    10,20,30

This input has 6 bushes, some of which may share the same color.

The most common color here is `10,20,30` since that color appears twice, more than any other color.

_Which color appears most frequently in the full list?_ (Your answer is the full color separated by commas and no spaces)

Your answer was: `27,73,88`

## -= Part 2: Color Coded =-

The salesman is happy with your work, but they have another request.

"Can you help me label my bushes based on the color as well?" they ask. "I label them **Red**, **Green**, **Blue** or **Special**."

* A bush is labeled **Red** if the amount of red (the first number) is greater than both green and blue.
* A bush is labeled **Green** if the amount of green (the second number) is greater than red and greater than blue.
* A bush is labeled **Blue** if the amount of blue (the third number) is greater than red and greater than green.
* A bush is labeled **Special** if 2 or more colors are equal.

**For example:**

Input:

    10,20,30
    20,10,30
    30,20,10
    10,50,10
    50,10,50
    10,20,30

This same input, but now labeled:

    10,20,30: Blue
    20,10,30: Blue
    30,20,10: Red
    10,50,10: Special
    50,10,50: Special
    10,20,30: Blue

Some notes:

* When a bush is labeled as **Special**, it should not be labeled as **Red**, **Green**, or **Blue**. (Being Special always takes priority)
* Even if the amount of a color is bigger than the other two, it should still be labeled as **Special** if two or more colors are equal. (`10,50,10` is special even if the green value is higher)
* If all three colors are equal, the bush is also labeled as **Special**.

Because the salesman is unsure if the exotic bushes will sell well, they for now just want to know how many bushes are labeled **Green**.

_How many bushes are labeled "Green" in the full list?_

Your answer was: `764`

### \-= Part 3: Colorful Calculations =-

After you're done, the salesman is on the phone with a customer. After a while, they hang up and tell you with a smile that the customer wants to buy all the bushes.

Each bush's price depends on its color.
The prices are as follows (in Pointers, the local currency of C-land):

* **Red** bushes are **5** Pointers
* **Green** bushes are **2** Pointers
* **Blue** bushes are **4** Pointers
* **Special** bushes are **10** Pointers

_After labeling all the bushes, what is their total price in Pointers?_

Your answer was: `11175`

You've completed all the parts for this puzzle! This earns you 3 Pointers \*\*\*!
